# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*I still need some practice with it, especially with more advanced actions like printing the length of characters or words. For basic commands, I feel good though.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*It felt satisfying, albeit a little nerve wracking! It was definitely a good way to push myself to tie together different concepts and really understand how the code works.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I still need to practice getting more comfortable with more advanced uses of the each method.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*None right now but will continue asking in Slack. I have also been looking through some coding youtube channels that are easy to follow.
